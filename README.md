An extendable graphics playout client that's both a desktop app and cloud service

**This project is still in early development**

## Goals

- [ ] ⚡️ To be a server agnostic, lightweight and quick playout client
- [ ] 🧑‍💻 To be easily extendable with plugins and encourage contribution 
- [ ] 💪 To provide a reliable backbone for productions

## Motivation  

As developers of production software we found ourselves in a position of rebuilding tools with similar functionality and core features time and time again. Bridge is a collection of core tools and a platform for plugins that enables reuse of the tools we build. Not only does it encourage a mix-and-match mindset where productions can choose from a selection of already built components, it cuts down on development time and enforces stability.

## Features

- [ ] Core features are bundled (rundown, default types, timeline e.t.c.)
- [ ] Can be run both as a desktop app and a cloud deployment
- [ ] Can be used by many operators simultaneously with real time sync
- [ ] A fully customizable grid layout
